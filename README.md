# Advent of Code example solutions in Elixir

My solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/), written in Elixir.

## Couple of words about the project

This is a mix project, so if you clone the repo, you can run the tests via `mix test`.

To find a solution to a quiz, run the `advent_of_code.day` task like so:

```shell
# mix advent_of_code.day <day-name> "<input>"
mix advent_of_code.day ten "1113222113"
```
